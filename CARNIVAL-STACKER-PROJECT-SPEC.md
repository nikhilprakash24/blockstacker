3. **Movement**: Horizontal left-right oscillation
4. **Speed**: Progressive increase with each successful placement
5. **Grid**: 7 columns × 15 rows (mobile version)
6. **Prize levels**: Minor prize at row 11, major prize at row 15

---

## Core Game Mechanics

### 1. Starting Configuration
```
- Initial blocks: 3
- Starting position: Left side of grid
- Movement direction: Left → Right
- Grid dimensions: 7 columns × 15 rows
```

### 2. Movement Pattern

**Horizontal Oscillation**
- Blocks move continuously side-to-side
- Pattern: LEFT → CENTER → RIGHT → CENTER → LEFT (repeat)
- Movement style: Smooth continuous motion (mobile) or discrete LED jumps (arcade)
- No off-screen disappearance in mobile version (arcade version does go off-screen)

### 3. Block Placement System

**On Button Press:**
1. Moving blocks freeze at current position
2. Alignment check performed against blocks below
3. Perfectly aligned blocks → RETAINED
4. Overhanging blocks → REMOVED immediately
5. Remaining blocks become base for next level

**Example Scenarios:**
```
3 blocks align perfectly → Keep all 3 → Next level has 3 blocks
2 blocks align, 1 overhangs → Keep 2, lose 1 → Next level has 2 blocks  
1 block aligns, 2 overhang → Keep 1, lose 2 → Next level has 1 block
0 blocks align (complete miss) → GAME OVER
```

### 4. Progressive Difficulty

**Speed Progression Formula:**
```javascript
const baseOscillationTime = 1200; // milliseconds (1.2 seconds)
const speedMultiplier = 1.0 + (currentLevel * 0.1);
const currentOscillationTime = baseOscillationTime / speedMultiplier;

// Examples:
// Level 1:  1200 / 1.0 = 1200ms (1.20 sec)
// Level 5:  1200 / 1.5 = 800ms  (0.80 sec)
// Level 10: 1200 / 2.0 = 600ms  (0.60 sec)
// Level 15: 1200 / 2.5 = 480ms  (0.48 sec)
```

**Speed by Level Range:**
```
Level 1-3:   1.0-1.2 sec per cycle (beginner)
Level 4-6:   0.8-1.0 sec per cycle (intermediate)
Level 7-10:  0.6-0.8 sec per cycle (advanced)
Level 11-14: 0.5-0.6 sec per cycle (expert)
Level 15:    0.4-0.5 sec per cycle (master)
```

**Timing Precision Required:**
```
Level 1:  ~85ms per column (forgiving)
Level 5:  ~57ms per column (requires focus)
Level 10: ~43ms per column (requires skill)
Level 15: ~34ms per column (expert timing)
```

   └─> Begin oscillating

2. PLAYER INPUT
   └─> Tap/click to freeze blocks
   
3. ALIGNMENT CHECK
   └─> Compare with blocks below
   └─> Remove overhanging blocks
   └─> Keep aligned blocks

4. NEXT LEVEL
   └─> Spawn new row above
   └─> Increase speed
   └─> Continue oscillation

5. REPEAT until:
   └─> Complete miss (game over)
   └─> Minor prize reached (choice)
   └─> Major prize won (victory!)
```

## Physics Implementations (3 Branches)

### Branch A: Continuous Physics
**Smooth overlap trimming with 1.3× speed multiplier**

**Pros:**
- Smooth, realistic movement
- Forgiving for beginners
- Good visual feedback

**Cons:**
- May be too easy
- Not authentic to arcade LED style

**Best for:** Mobile/web version, learning mode

### Branch B: Discrete Physics  
**50% threshold, whole blocks fall**

**Pros:**
- More challenging
- Clear pass/fail per block
- Good middle ground

**Cons:**
- Can feel harsh at 50% threshold
- Fixed glitches needed attention

**Best for:** Intermediate difficulty mode

### Branch C: Snap-to-Grid Physics
**Tetris-like alignment (previous issues fixed)**

**Pros:**
- Most arcade-like
- Clear grid-based mechanics
- Unified platform logic resolved issues

**Cons:**
- Can be unforgiving
- Requires pixel-perfect timing

**Best for:** Authentic arcade simulation

### Recommendation
**Implement all three as difficulty modes:**
- Easy Mode = Branch A (continuous, forgiving)
- Normal Mode = Branch B (discrete, balanced)
- Arcade Mode = Branch C (snap-to-grid, authentic)

│  Score: 12345  Record: 28392│
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Visual Feedback
- **Block freeze**: Immediate stop, slight flash
- **Perfect alignment**: Green highlight, +bonus score
- **Partial alignment**: Yellow highlight for kept blocks, red for lost blocks
- **Complete miss**: Red flash, blocks fall, game over screen
- **Prize reached**: Celebration animation, choice prompt (minor) or victory screen (major)

---

## Audio Design (Recommendations)

### Sound Effects
- **Button press**: Satisfying "click" or "tap"
- **Block placement**: "Thud" when blocks settle
- **Block loss**: Negative "whoosh" for trimmed blocks
- **Perfect placement**: Positive "ding" or "ping"
- **Level up**: Rising pitch tone
- **Minor prize reached**: Fanfare, choice prompt sound
- **Major prize won**: Victory celebration music
- **Game over**: Descending tone, sympathetic sound

### Background Music
**Two options:**

1. **Fair Mode** (for practice):
   - Calm, consistent background music
   - Helps players find rhythm
   - Doesn't change with speed

2. **Arcade Mode** (authentic):
   - Music starts on-beat with blocks
   - Gradually goes OFF-BEAT at higher levels (like real arcade)
   - Designed to disrupt player timing
   - Players should ignore music and watch visually

---

## Timing Configuration

### Precision Levels

**Beginner (Easy Mode)**
```javascript
{
  winWindow: 50, // milliseconds - very forgiving
  baseSpeed: 1500, // slower than video
  speedIncrease: 0.05 // gentler progression
}
```

**Normal (Practice Mode)**  
```javascript
{
  winWindow: 20, // milliseconds - fair timing
  baseSpeed: 1200, // matches video
  speedIncrease: 0.10 // standard progression
}
```

**Arcade (Challenge Mode)**
```javascript
{
  winWindow: 5, // milliseconds - very precise
  baseSpeed: 1000, // faster start
  speedIncrease: 0.15 // aggressive progression
}
```

**Rigged Arcade (Educational)**
```javascript
{
  winWindow: 1-20, // variable based on "payout counter"
  blockSpeedManipulation: true, // speeds up just before alignment
  payoutRatio: 400, // 1 win per 400 plays
  showManipulation: true // educational: show when rigged
}
```

## Key Differences: Mobile vs Arcade

### Mobile Version (from video)
✅ 7 columns wide
✅ Smooth pixel-based movement
✅ Blocks stay on-screen
✅ Fair timing (no rigging)
✅ Smaller, more visible
✅ Good for learning

### Real Arcade Machine
✅ 11 columns wide
✅ Discrete LED-style movement
✅ Blocks go off-screen with variable delays
✅ Rigged timing (payout manipulation)
✅ Larger, more intimidating
✅ Music goes off-beat to disrupt timing

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Start with mobile version** (easier, matches video)
2. **Add arcade features gradually** (11-column option, LED style)
3. **Offer both modes** (mobile for learning, arcade for challenge)
4. **Educational rigging mode** (shows when manipulation occurs)

---

## Success Criteria

### For Practice/Training App
- Users improve timing consistency over sessions
- Players successfully transfer skills to real arcade
- Clear progression from beginner to expert levels
- Engaging enough for repeated practice
- Fair feedback on performance

### For Authentic Simulation
- Accurately represents real arcade difficulty
- Includes optional rigged mechanics for education
- Teaches strategies that work on real machines
- Honest about when real arcade is manipulating timing

---

## User Strategies to Teach

### Beginner Tips
1. **Pick a side**: Stack along left OR right edge (not center)
2. **Ignore the music**: Focus only on visual movement
3. **Watch the rhythm**: Find the pattern before pressing
4. **Start slow**: Use easy mode until comfortable
5. **Aim for consistency**: Perfect placement matters more than speed

### Intermediate Tips
1. **Anticipate speed changes**: Press slightly earlier as levels increase
2. **Maintain 3 blocks**: Perfect placement = easier subsequent levels
3. **Track the pattern**: Blocks move in predictable oscillations
4. **Stay calm at minor prize**: Make the risk/reward decision rationally
5. **Practice specific levels**: Repeat challenging levels to improve

### Advanced Tips
1. **Develop muscle memory**: Consistent timing across all speeds
2. **Pre-press adjustment**: Account for button press delay
3. **Visual chunking**: See blocks as units, not individual lights
4. **Speed adaptation**: Quickly adjust to sudden speed increases
5. **Accept the rigging**: In arcade mode, know when machine is manipulating you

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### In Game Design
❌ Starting with 4 blocks (should be 3)
❌ Losing blocks on level progression (should only lose on misalignment)
❌ Vertical falling blocks (this is NOT Tetris - horizontal only)
❌ Constant speed (must progressively increase)
❌ No prize levels (minor/major are essential)
❌ Perfect grid alignment only (some tolerance needed for mobile)

### In User Experience  
❌ Too difficult initially (frustrates new players)
❌ No feedback on timing (players can't improve blind)
❌ Missing progression indicators (show improvement!)
❌ Inconsistent physics (confuses muscle memory)
❌ Unclear when blocks will be lost (be obvious)
