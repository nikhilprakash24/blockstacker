---

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY

**This is a MOBILE GAME simulation, not the physical arcade machine footage.**

The video shows a mobile app available on Google Play that simulates the carnival Stacker arcade game. While it follows similar mechanics to the real arcade version, there are some differences in presentation and possibly timing.

---

## CORE MECHANICS OBSERVED

### 1. Starting Configuration
✅ **CONFIRMED: 3 blocks to start**
- Game begins with 3 blocks moving together as a unit
- Your correction was accurate!

### 2. Movement Pattern
**Horizontal Oscillation (Left-to-Right)**
- Blocks move continuously from left to right and back
- Pattern: LEFT → CENTER → RIGHT → CENTER → LEFT (repeat)
- Movement is **smooth continuous motion**, not discrete LED-style jumps
- Blocks stay on-screen throughout oscillation (no off-screen disappearance observed)

### 3. Grid Dimensions
- **Width**: Approximately 7 columns
- **Height**: Approximately 15 rows
- **Minor Prize**: Located around row 10-11 (middle section)
- **Major Prize**: Top row (row 15)

### 4. Timing Measurements

#### **Initial Levels (Rows 1-3)**
- **Full oscillation (left-right-left)**: ~1.0-1.2 seconds
- **Time per column**: ~70-85ms
- **Movement speed**: Moderate, very manageable

#### **Mid Levels (Rows 4-10)**
- **Full oscillation**: ~0.7-0.9 seconds (estimated)
- **Movement speed**: Noticeably faster

#### **Upper Levels (Rows 11-15)**
- **Full oscillation**: ~0.5-0.6 seconds (estimated)
- **Movement speed**: Very fast, requires quick reactions

**Note**: These are estimates from 25fps video. Actual timing may vary slightly, but gives good approximation for simulation.

### 5. Block Placement Mechanics

#### **Alignment System**
1. Player taps screen to freeze moving blocks
2. Blocks that align with the stack below = RETAINED
3. Blocks that overhang (don't align) = REMOVED immediately
4. Remaining blocks become the base for next level

#### **Block Loss Pattern**
✅ **CONFIRMED: Blocks only lost on misalignment** (not on level progression)
- If 3 blocks perfectly align → keep all 3 for next level
- If 2 blocks align → lose 1 block, continue with 2
- If 1 block aligns → lose 2 blocks, continue with 1
- If 0 blocks align → GAME OVER

**Your correction was 100% accurate!**

### 6. Progressive Difficulty

#### **Speed Increases**
The game gets progressively harder through:
1. **Faster oscillation** - blocks move quicker at each level
2. **Smaller target area** - fewer blocks means smaller landing zone
3. **Increased pressure** - proximity to prizes increases stress

#### **Block Reduction**
- Start: 3 blocks wide
- Typical progression: 3 → 3 → 2 → 2 → 1 → 1
- By major prize level: Often down to 1 block
- This makes the final levels EXTREMELY challenging

## VISUAL & UI ELEMENTS

### Prize Indicators
- **"MAJOR PRIZE"** label at top of grid
- **"MINOR PRIZE"** label in middle section
- When player reaches minor prize level, the label **HIGHLIGHTS IN CYAN**
- Score counter on side of screen
- Record/high score displayed at top

### Color Scheme
- **Grid background**: Dark blue
- **Grid lines**: Light blue borders
- **Blocks**: Cyan/light blue
- **Active/moving blocks**: Bright cyan
- **Placed blocks**: Solid cyan

### Dual-Screen Layout
The video shows **TWO game grids side-by-side**:
- **Left grid**: Shows one gameplay session
- **Right grid**: Shows second gameplay session
- Both appear to be the same game, possibly showing comparison or replay

## COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL ARCADE STACKER

### Similarities ✅
1. 3 blocks to start
2. Horizontal left-right oscillation
3. Block trimming on misalignment
4. Progressive speed increase
5. Minor prize checkpoint
6. Major prize at top
7. Stack builds from bottom up

### Differences ⚠️
1. **Display style**: Mobile uses smooth pixels vs arcade LED lights
2. **Movement**: Appears smoother in mobile vs discrete LED column jumps
3. **Grid size**: Mobile appears to be 7 columns vs arcade's typical 11 columns
4. **Off-screen behavior**: Mobile blocks stay visible vs arcade blocks going off-screen
5. **Music**: Mobile game music not analyzed vs arcade's deliberate off-beat timing
6. **"Rigged" mechanics**: Mobile app likely fair vs arcade's payout manipulation

## KEY TIMING DATA FOR SIMULATION

### Oscillation Speed by Level
```
Level 1-3:   ~1.0-1.2 sec per cycle   (beginner)
Level 4-6:   ~0.8-1.0 sec per cycle   (intermediate)
Level 7-10:  ~0.6-0.8 sec per cycle   (advanced)
Level 11-14: ~0.5-0.6 sec per cycle   (expert)
Level 15:    ~0.4-0.5 sec per cycle   (master)
```

### Speed Multiplier Formula
```
speed_multiplier = 1.0 + (level * 0.1)
oscillation_time = base_time / speed_multiplier

Example:
Level 1: base_time = 1.2s → 1.2 / 1.0 = 1.20s
Level 5: base_time = 1.2s → 1.2 / 1.5 = 0.80s
Level 10: base_time = 1.2s → 1.2 / 2.0 = 0.60s
Level 15: base_time = 1.2s → 1.2 / 2.5 = 0.48s
```

### Millisecond Precision Requirements
Based on 7-column grid and timing:
- **Level 1**: ~85ms per column (relatively forgiving)
- **Level 5**: ~57ms per column (requires focus)
- **Level 10**: ~43ms per column (requires skill)
- **Level 15**: ~34ms per column (expert timing)

---

## GAME FLOW OBSERVED

### Typical Session Progression
1. **Game starts** → 3 blocks appear on left side
2. **Blocks oscillate** → Move continuously left-right
3. **Player taps** → Blocks freeze at current position
4. **Alignment check** → Overhang removed, aligned blocks stay
5. **Next level spawns** → New row appears, moving faster
6. **Repeat** → Continue until game over or prize won

### Success Patterns
- **Perfect play**: Maintain all 3 blocks → easier subsequent levels
- **Good play**: Lose 1 block → harder but manageable
- **Struggling**: Down to 1 block → very difficult to continue
- **Expert level**: Successfully place single block at high speed

### Failure Patterns
- **Early game**: Usually caused by poor timing or impatience
- **Mid game**: Often lose blocks due to increasing speed
- **Late game**: Single-block precision too difficult at high speed
- **Minor prize decision**: Some players stop to claim minor prize vs risking major

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SIMULATION

### For Authentic Practice
1. **Use 7-column grid** (matches this mobile version)
   - OR use 11-column grid (matches physical arcade)
   - **Recommendation**: Start with 7-column for easier visibility

2. **Implement smooth oscillation** (like mobile)
   - OR use discrete LED-style jumps (like arcade)
   - **Recommendation**: Use smooth for better mobile experience

3. **Progressive speed formula**:
   ```javascript
   const baseTime = 1200; // 1.2 seconds
   const level = currentLevel;
   const speedMultiplier = 1.0 + (level * 0.1);
   const oscillationTime = baseTime / speedMultiplier;
   ```

4. **Block trimming system**:
   ```javascript
   // On button press:
   function checkAlignment(movingBlocks, baseBlocks) {
     const aligned = movingBlocks.filter(block => 
       baseBlocks.some(base => base.column === block.column)
     );
     const trimmed = movingBlocks.length - aligned.length;
     return { aligned, trimmed };
   }
   ```

5. **Fair vs Rigged Modes**:
   - **Practice Mode**: Fair timing (10-20ms window)
   - **Arcade Simulation**: Include difficulty manipulation for realism
   - **Easy Mode**: Generous timing (50ms+ window) for learning

### Visual Feedback
- Clear indication when blocks freeze
- Highlight aligned vs trimmed blocks
- Show block count clearly
- Prize level indicators must be prominent
- Score should increase with height

### Audio Considerations
Since video audio wasn't analyzed, consider:
- Button press sound (satisfying click)
- Block placement sound (thud/snap)
- Miss/fail sound (negative feedback)
- Prize level reached sound (celebration)
- Background music (optional, can be distracting)

## SKILL TRANSFER ASSESSMENT

### What This Mobile Game Teaches
✅ **Timing practice** - develops rhythm and button press timing
✅ **Speed adaptation** - learning to adjust as difficulty increases  
✅ **Pressure handling** - managing stress as stack gets higher
✅ **Risk assessment** - minor prize vs major prize decision
✅ **Visual tracking** - following moving blocks accurately

### Limitations vs Real Arcade
⚠️ **Smoother movement** - Mobile is more forgiving than discrete LEDs
⚠️ **No off-screen timing** - Real arcade has variable off-screen delays
⚠️ **No music distraction** - Real arcade uses off-beat music as distraction
⚠️ **Fair difficulty** - No payout manipulation like real arcade
⚠️ **Smaller grid** - 7 columns vs 11 means different spacing

### Skill Transfer Effectiveness
**Overall Rating: 7.5/10**

**Good for:**
- General timing practice
- Speed adaptation training
- Building confidence
- Understanding mechanics

**Not perfect for:**
- Exact arcade timing (different grid size)

### Critical Insight

This is a **mobile game simulation** of the arcade Stacker, NOT footage of the physical arcade machine. This means:

- **Timing is slightly different** (smoother, possibly more forgiving)
- **Grid size is different** (7 vs 11 columns)
- **No rigged mechanics** (fair gameplay vs payout manipulation)
- **Movement style differs** (smooth pixels vs discrete LEDs)

**For your training app**, you should decide:
1. **Match the mobile version** (easier, what's shown in video)
2. **Match the real arcade** (harder, more authentic)
3. **Offer both modes** (best of both worlds!)

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Build the mobile version first** (simpler, matches your video)
2. **Add timing customization** (let users adjust difficulty)
3. **Track improvement metrics** (show skill development)
4. **Later add arcade mode** (with LED-style and rigged mechanics)
5. **Use video as reference** (this is your baseline!)
