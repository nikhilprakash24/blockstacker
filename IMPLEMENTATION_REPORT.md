# Ad Integration Implementation Report

**Branch:** `ad-integration`
**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## Summary

Successfully integrated Google AdMob monetization into Block Stacker Carnivale with three ad types:
1. **Banner Ads** - Bottom of screen during gameplay
2. **Interstitial Ads** - Full-screen after game over (every 3-5 games)
3. **Rewarded Video Ads** - Optional at Minor Prize screen for instant continue

---

## Files Created

### 1. `src/config/adConfig.ts`
**Purpose:** Central configuration for all AdMob IDs and settings

**Contents:**
- Test AdMob IDs (Google's official test IDs - safe for development)
- Production AdMob IDs (placeholders - you need to replace these)
- `USE_TEST_ADS` toggle (currently `true` for safety)
- Ad frequency settings (interstitial every 3-5 games)

**Important:**
- **NEVER** use production IDs during testing (will get account banned)
- Replace production placeholders with your real AdMob IDs from admob.google.com
- Set `USE_TEST_ADS = false` only when submitting to App Store

---

### 2. `src/services/adService.ts`
**Purpose:** Complete AdMob service handling all ad operations

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ AdMob initialization with iOS 14+ tracking permission
- ‚úÖ Banner ad management (show/hide/remove)
- ‚úÖ Interstitial ad preloading and display
- ‚úÖ Rewarded video ad with completion tracking
- ‚úÖ Error handling (app works without ads if AdMob fails)
- ‚úÖ Native platform detection (doesn't try to load ads in browser)
- ‚úÖ Automatic ad preloading for smooth experience

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
adService.initialize()          // Initialize AdMob (call once on app start)
adService.showBanner()          // Show banner at bottom of screen
adService.hideBanner()          // Hide banner (e.g., on start screen)
adService.showInterstitial()    // Show full-screen ad
adService.showRewarded()        // Show rewarded video, returns promise
adService.preloadRewarded()     // Preload rewarded ad
adService.isRewardedReady()     // Check if rewarded ad is ready
adService.cleanup()             // Remove all ads (on app close)
```

## Dependencies Installed

### `@capacitor-community/admob`
**Version:** Latest (installed via npm)
**Purpose:** Capacitor plugin for Google AdMob integration
**Platform Support:** iOS and Android
**Documentation:** [github.com/capacitor-community/admob](https://github.com/capacitor-community/admob)

---

## Configuration Required (To Do After Implementation)

### 1. Create AdMob Account
- Go to [admob.google.com](https://admob.google.com)
- Sign up with Google account
- Add iOS app (even if not published yet)
- Get **App ID** (looks like `ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY`)

### 2. Create 3 Ad Units
- **Banner:** Adaptive banner for game screen
- **Interstitial:** Full-screen for game over
- **Rewarded Video:** For Minor Prize continue option

### 3. Update Production IDs
**File:** `src/config/adConfig.ts`

Replace these placeholder values:
```typescript
production: {
  appId: 'ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY',  // Your real App ID
  bannerId: 'ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/1111111111',  // Your real Banner ID
  interstitialId: 'ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/2222222222',  // Your real Interstitial ID
  rewardedId: 'ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/3333333333',  // Your real Rewarded ID
}
```

### 4. iOS Info.plist Configuration
**File:** `ios/App/App/Info.plist` (created after running `npx cap add ios`)

Add before final `</dict>`:
```xml
<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
<string>YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID_HERE</string>
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses your data to show personalized ads and support free gameplay.</string>
<key>SKAdNetworkItems</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>SKAdNetworkIdentifier</key>
    <string>cstr6suwn9.skadnetwork</string>
  </dict>
</array>
```

---

## Testing Instructions

### Phase 1: Local Web Testing (Current)

Ads won't work in the browser, but you can verify:
- ‚úÖ App compiles without errors
- ‚úÖ Game still functions normally
- ‚úÖ Ad service doesn't break anything

**Run:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected:** Game works normally, console shows "Skipping ads (not native platform)"

---

### Phase 2: iOS Simulator Testing (After Capacitor Setup)

1. **Initialize Capacitor:**
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios
npx cap init
# Enter: App Name, Bundle ID, Web Dir (dist)
npx cap add ios
```

2. **Build and sync:**
```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
```

3. **Test in Xcode Simulator:**
- Run app in iOS Simulator
- Test ads with **TEST IDs** (already configured)
- Banner should appear at bottom
- Play 5 games to trigger interstitial
- Reach Minor Prize to test rewarded video

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Banner ad shows "Test Ad" at bottom
- ‚úÖ Interstitial shows after 3-5 game overs
- ‚úÖ Rewarded video button works at Minor Prize
- ‚úÖ All ads closeable instantly (test ads don't require waiting)

---

### Phase 3: Real Device Testing

**Why:** Simulator doesn't show real ad rendering

**Steps:**
1. Connect iPhone to Cloud Mac via USB
2. Select iPhone in Xcode device dropdown
3. Click Run ‚ñ∂
4. Test all 3 ad types

**With TEST IDs:**
- ‚úÖ Safe to click ads (no account risk)
- ‚úÖ Ads load quickly
- ‚úÖ Can test repeatedly

**Important:** Do NOT test with production IDs on your own device!

---

### Phase 4: Production Testing (Before App Store Submission)

1. **Switch to production IDs:**
```typescript
// In src/config/adConfig.ts
export const USE_TEST_ADS = false;
```

2. **Rebuild:**
```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync ios
```

3. **Test on friend's/family member's device** (NOT your own!)
4. Verify:
   - Real ads load
   - Banner displays correctly
   - Interstitial shows at right frequency
   - Rewarded video works

---

## Ad Implementation Details

### Banner Ad
**When Shown:**
- ‚úÖ When game starts (user clicks "Start Game")
- ‚úÖ During active gameplay
- ‚ùå NOT on start screen

**Position:** Bottom of screen, above iOS safe area

**Size:** Adaptive (adjusts to screen width)

**Refresh:** Automatic by AdMob (typically every 60 seconds)

---

### Interstitial Ad
**When Shown:**
- After game over
- Frequency: Every 3-5 games (randomized)
- Example: Game 1 ‚ùå, Game 2 ‚ùå, Game 3 ‚ùå, Game 4 üé¨ AD, Game 5 ‚ùå, Game 6 ‚ùå, Game 7 ‚ùå, Game 8 üé¨ AD

**Timing:** Shows when user clicks "Try Again" or "Play Again"

**Preloading:** Automatically preloaded after banner loads

**Fallback:** If ad fails to load, game restarts normally

---

### Rewarded Video Ad
**When Available:**
- At Minor Prize screen (Row 11 reached)
- User can choose to watch or skip

**Reward:** Instant continue (bypasses 1-second cooldown)

**Completion Required:** User must watch full ad (15-30 seconds) to get reward

**Preloading:** Preloaded when app starts

**User Experience:**
- Optional (not forced)
- Clear value proposition
- Alternative: Free "Continue" button with 1-second wait

---

## Revenue Projections

### Conservative Estimates:

**Assumptions:**
- Average eCPM: $5-10
- Banner impressions: ~10 per session
- Interstitial impressions: 1 per 4 games
- Rewarded video: 20% opt-in rate

**Daily Active Users ‚Üí Monthly Revenue:**
- 100 users ‚Üí $60-150
- 1,000 users ‚Üí $600-1,500
- 10,000 users ‚Üí $6,000-15,000
- 100,000 users ‚Üí $60,000-150,000

**Factors:**
- Higher in US/Canada/Europe
- Lower in Asia/South America
- Depends heavily on retention

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Web Testing
**Issue:** Ads don't work in browser during `npm run dev`

**Reason:** AdMob requires native iOS/Android platform

**Solution:** Test in iOS Simulator or real device

---

### 2. Simulator Ad Fill
**Issue:** Ads may not always load in iOS Simulator

**Reason:** Limited simulator network capabilities

**Solution:** Use test IDs (always work) or test on real device

---

### 3. First Ad Load Time
**Issue:** First ad may take 2-3 seconds to load

**Reason:** Cold start, fetching from AdMob servers

**Mitigation:**
- ‚úÖ Preload interstitial after banner loads
- ‚úÖ Preload rewarded on app start
- ‚úÖ Show next game immediately (don't wait for ad)

---

## Error Handling

### Scenario: AdMob Fails to Initialize
**Cause:** No internet, invalid IDs, AdMob service down

**Behavior:** App logs error but continues working without ads

**User Impact:** None (game plays normally)

---

### Scenario: Ad Fails to Load
**Cause:** No ad inventory, network issue, invalid ID

**Behavior:**
- Banner: Space remains empty
- Interstitial: Game restarts without ad
- Rewarded: Shows error message

**User Impact:** Minimal (game still playable)

---

### Scenario: User Closes Rewarded Ad Early
**Behavior:** Ad closes, game does NOT continue

**Alert:** "Please watch the full ad to continue playing!"

**User Can:** Click regular "Continue" button instead

---
