# Ad Integration - Quick Summary

**Branch:** `ad-integration` (pushed to GitHub)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and Ready for Review

---

## What Was Done

I've successfully implemented a complete AdMob monetization system for Block Stacker with three types of ads:

### 1. üü¶ Banner Ads
- Small ad at bottom of game screen
- Shows during gameplay, hidden on start screen
- Automatically refreshes

### 2. üü• Interstitial Ads
- Full-screen ad between games
- Shows after game over every 3-5 games (randomized)
- Non-intrusive timing

### 3. üü© Rewarded Video Ads
- Optional "Watch Ad to Continue" button at Minor Prize
- User must watch full ad (15-30 seconds)
- Reward: Instant continue without waiting

## Files to Read (In Order)

### 1. **IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md** (START HERE!)
Read this first for complete technical details of what I implemented.

### 2. **IOS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**
Follow this step-by-step when you're ready to deploy to iOS.
Covers: Cloud Mac setup, Xcode, App Store submission.

### 3. **AD_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**
Follow this to set up your AdMob account and configure ads.
Covers: Creating ad units, getting IDs, testing, going live.

## What You Need to Do

### Immediate:
1. ‚úÖ Read `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` completely
2. ‚¨ú Review the code changes in `src/` folder
3. ‚¨ú Decide if you want to merge this to `master` or test first

### Before Testing:
1. ‚¨ú Create Google AdMob account at [admob.google.com](https://admob.google.com)
2. ‚¨ú Create 3 ad units (banner, interstitial, rewarded video)
3. ‚¨ú Copy your Ad Unit IDs
4. ‚¨ú Update production IDs in `src/config/adConfig.ts`

### For iOS Deployment:
1. ‚¨ú Sign up for Cloud Mac service (MacStadium or MacInCloud)
2. ‚¨ú Get Apple Developer account ($99/year)
3. ‚¨ú Follow `IOS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` step-by-step

## Important Safety Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER Use Production Ad IDs While Testing
**Why:** Clicking your own ads = instant AdMob account ban

**Solution:** Use test IDs (already configured as default)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Only Switch to Production Before App Store Upload
In `src/config/adConfig.ts`:
```typescript
export const USE_TEST_ADS = false;  // Change this ONLY before final upload
```

---

## Files Created

**Configuration:**
- `src/config/adConfig.ts` - Ad IDs and settings

**Service:**
- `src/services/adService.ts` - Complete AdMob implementation

**Documentation:**
- `IOS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - iOS deployment (7,000+ words)
- `AD_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - AdMob setup (6,000+ words)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` - Technical details
- `AD_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

**Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Integrated ads into game
- `src/gameState.ts` - Added ad tracking
- `package.json` - Added AdMob dependency

---

## Testing Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] TypeScript type safety verified
- [x] App runs in development mode (ads don't work in browser - expected)
- [x] Documentation complete

### ‚¨ú To Do (Requires iOS Setup):
- [ ] Test with Capacitor iOS setup
- [ ] Test banner ad in iOS Simulator
- [ ] Test interstitial ad frequency
- [ ] Test rewarded video at Minor Prize
- [ ] Test on real iPhone device

## Revenue Estimates

**Conservative projections:**

| Daily Users | Monthly Revenue |
|------------|-----------------|
| 100 | $60-150 |
| 1,000 | $600-1,500 |
| 10,000 | $6,000-15,000 |
| 100,000 | $60,000-150,000 |

*Actual revenue varies by geography, engagement, and ad fill rates*

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Merge Now (Recommended)
The code is safe - ads only work on native iOS, not in browser. Merge to master so it's in your main codebase.

```bash
git checkout master
git merge ad-integration
git push
```

### Option 2: Test First
Wait until you have Cloud Mac + Xcode set up, then test in iOS Simulator before merging.

### Option 3: Keep Separate
Keep this branch separate until you're ready to deploy to App Store.
